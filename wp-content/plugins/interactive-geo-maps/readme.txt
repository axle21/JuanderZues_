[Features Examples](https://interactivegeomaps.com/features/) | [Go Pro](https://interactivegeomaps.com/pricing/)

The plugin generates interactive, responsive, touch-enabled SVG maps which are embeded directly into your HTML5 pages and compatible with all modern browsers and devices.

= Privacy Information & External Services =
This plugin will build the maps using the [amcharts visualization library](https://www.amcharts.com/javascript-charts/) which provides hundreds of different maps. The plugin loads some files from their CDN to build the map and display it on your page. You won't need to have a amcharts account for the maps to work. More information about their [amcharts Privacy Policy](https://www.amcharts.com/privacy-policy/).
When you first install the plugin, you can choose to [opt-in to share non-sensitive data with Freemius](https://interactivegeomaps.com/docs/opt-in-to-non-sensitive-diagnostic-tracking/), a framework we use to collect data about your WordPress installation that will help us improve the plugin. This is optional and the plugin will still work if you don't opt-in. It will not collect any data from your visitors.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I need an amcharts account or license for the plugin to work? =
No, you won't need any license or specific account. The plugin will work out of the box.

= Do I need a Google Maps API Key for the plugin to work? =
No, you won't need one. The plugin will not use the Google Maps API. However you can add a Google Maps API Key in the settings of the plugin to enable geocoding when adding markers and therefore get the latitude and longitude directly in the plugin's administration.

= Where can I get coordinates for a marker? =
You can get the latitude and longitude needed to a add a marker to a map using sites like [GetLatLong](https://getlatlong.net/) or [LatLong.net](https://www.latlong.net/) or any other similar website. Optionally, you can add a Google Maps API Key in the settings page of the plugin and this will enable you to get the coordinates directly in the map administration panel, when adding a maker. In this case, Google's geocoding service is only used in the administration to get the coordinates, it won't be used when the map displays in your pages.

= Where can I learn how to use the plugin? =
You can visit the [documentation pages on the official website](https://interactivegeomaps.com/documentation/).
